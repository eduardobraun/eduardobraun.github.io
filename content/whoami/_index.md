Hello, my name is `Eduardo Braun`.

I started learning to code around the year 2000, when as a kid I loved to use
the IRC and it was natural to delve into creating chatting tools and bots.

In 2008 I got my first job as a embedded developer, coding mostly for ARM
`LPC2148` and ATMEGA microcontrollers. In the 4 years I spent there I did work on signal
acquisition and processing for a system that controlled the temperature inside
grain storage units.

After that, I moved to `Santa Maria` in 2012, where I studied `Computer
Engineering` at the `Universidade Federal de Santa Maria`.
There I participated in many research projects, most notably the work in
`Signal Processing` that resulted in the publication of the paper [Sleep Stages
Classification Using Spectral Based Statistical Moments as
Features](https://seer.ufrgs.br/rita/article/view/RITA_VOL25_NR1_11).

After my graduation, I worked for two years as a `Backend Developer` at
`Dinamize` where I coded microservices in `Go` for the company's mailmarketing
system.

Recently, I have been coding mostly in `Rust` for my personal projects.
